# Deloitte-Case-Study

Question
Our client at the NIH wants to build a program to address drug use among teenagers/young adults in the US. They are asking you to use existing data to understand factors that lead to drug use and make recommendations for the program, as well as help them understand
how and where they should start to roll out these programs.
