This is the simplest approach and can be used when the number of cases with missing response values is small and are Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). However, you can lose a lot of data if the number of missing values is substantial.\n",

    "- Mode imputation: Replace the missing values with the mode (most common value) of the non-missing values. This is a simple and fast method, but it can introduce bias if the missing data is not MCAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predictive mean matching (PMM): This involves using a model to predict the missing values from the other data, and then taking a random draw from the observed values with similar predicted values. This is more robust than simple model-based imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic regression imputation: Since the response variable is binary, you can fit a logistic regression model using the other variables, and then predict the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple Imputation: Similar to the continuous case, multiple imputation can be used. It acknowledges the uncertainty about the imputation by creating several different plausible imputed datasets and combining results obtained from each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the way you handle missing data in the response variable should depend on the reason why the data is missing. For example, if a response is missing not at random, meaning that the missingness is related to the underlying, unobserved response, excluding these cases or filling in with imputed values can lead to bias in your results. In such cases, more advanced techniques might be necessary, possibly involving using models that can handle missing data directly."

    "\n",
    "Neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be used with categorical data, but the data needs to be prepared appropriately and the right kind of network architecture must be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embedding Layers: In Neural Networks, categorical data is typically transformed into numeric form using an embedding layer, which maps each category to a dense vector of real numbers. The advantage of this approach is that the network can learn a representation that captures the relationships between categories in a way that one-hot encoding cannot. Our dataset appears to have satisfied this\n",
    "\n",
    "- Network Architecture: CNNs might not be the best fit for categorical data, *unless* the categorical data has some spatial or sequential structure. Fully connected networks (FCNs) or Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are usually more appropriate for structured, tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overfitting: Neural networks, particularly deep ones, can overfit to the training data if it is not large or diverse enough. Techniques like regularization, dropout, and early stopping can mitigate this risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** \n",
    "- the code for the cel below is not complete, so it is commented out for now. It also takes a very long time to run on a laptop since it is handling many layers and computations within our current Neural Network design. \n",
    "- This also suggests a Boosted Decision Tree may be a more efficient approach, and based on [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/when-and-why-tree-based-models-often-outperform-neural-networks-ceba9ecd0fd8), produce a more accurate result."
